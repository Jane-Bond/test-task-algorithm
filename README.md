tets tasks

Create an algorythm that does the following:
1. Function accepts random text as a string and in each word of the string finds first symbol that is unique for this word and this letter soen't appear again in that word.
It should return a string.
2. Next from that string of the first unique letters in each word it finds first unique letter in this new string and returns it.

For example, for this example string:

The Tao gave birth to machine language.  Machine language gave birth
to the assembler.
The assembler gave birth to the compiler.  Now there are ten thousand
languages.
Each language has its purpose, however humble.  Each language
expresses the Yin and Yang of software.  Each language has its place within
the Tao.
But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.
        -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"

it should return letter "m".
